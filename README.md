## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

### 1. Exercises
Exercises are organized by subject or topic.  
They allow me to apply the concepts learned in class:

- **Java**: data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming.  
- **JavaScript / Web Development**: DOM manipulation, API usage, interactive front-end development.  
- **Applied Mathematics**: numerical computing, statistics, optimization.

Each exercise includes:
- Objective and context
- Concepts and techniques used
- Expected results or test cases

### 2. Projects
Projects are more comprehensive works combining multiple skills and technologies:

- **Java Applications**: interactive programs, simulations, mini-games.  
- **PostgreSQL Databases**: database creation and management, SQL queries, table relationships.  
- **Web Applications (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)**: interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

Each project contains:
- A full description
- Technologies used
- Instructions for running locally
- Example usage or screenshots
